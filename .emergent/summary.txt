The AI engineer successfully transformed an initial request for a publicity campaign ordering app into a comprehensive LCA TV Burkina Faso application. The project evolved significantly, starting with foundational UI and authentication, then shifting entirely to the LCA TV requirements, including real-time YouTube integration and a complete user management system. The engineer demonstrated strong problem-solving skills, addressing dependency issues and adapting to design changes like the welcome page and side menu. The final work focused on packaging the application for local execution and integrating a download package feature into the app's sidebar. The process involved extensive file modifications, dependency installations, and rigorous backend testing, culminating in a fully functional and aesthetically polished mobile application.

Initially, the user requested an Android app to order publicity campaigns, allowing user accounts, campaign modality selection (video, text, audio), and content following/rating, with an attractive, modern design inspired by a taxi app reference.

The project then pivoted to create a modern mobile (Android/iOS) and responsive web application for LCA TV Burkina Faso. This included:
- Real-time YouTube integration with the official LCA TV channel.
- A complete user management system (registration, login, profile, viewing history, notifications, favorites, recommendations).
- A dynamic home page with breaking news banners, live video player, and popular show slider.
- Comprehensive navigation with a hamburger menu and sections for Home, Live, News, Shows, Advertising, Contact.
- Advanced video player features (full screen, adaptive quality, subtitles).
- A program advertising module with subscription, real-time tariff calculation, campaign management, and simplified analytics dashboard.
- Integrated billing with payment tracking and mobile payment options (Orange Money, Moov Money).
- A backend admin panel for content and user management, REST API with JWT, Swagger, rate limiting, and YouTube synchronization via webhooks.
- Modern Material Design UI, Burkina Faso-inspired color palette (green, yellow, red), Roboto/Open Sans typography, responsive cards, skeleton loading, fluid animations, and toast notifications.
- Special features: a breaking news system (scrolling banner, urgent/important/normal priorities, 30-second updates, API key provided), and integrated analytics.
- Lastly, an explicit request to add a welcome page with a modern design and a rounded watermark at the bottom, and subsequently, a side menu with all primary functions and other missing pages. The final addition was a Download Package option in the sidebar.

</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a monorepo structure with a  (FastAPI) and a  (Expo React Native) directory.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**: This is the core of the FastAPI backend.
    -   **Importance**: Handles all API endpoints for authentication, user management, campaign creation, YouTube integration, and content management. It serves as the primary data interface for the frontend.
    -   **Changes**: Initially contained campaign management, then was refactored significantly to integrate YouTube Data API, breaking news, full CRUD operations for LCA TV content, and a new endpoint for package download. It uses PyJWT for authentication and Pydantic for data validation.
-   **/app/frontend/app/index.tsx**: The main entry point and welcome screen of the Expo app.
    -   **Importance**: Manages the initial onboarding experience, transitions to the main application, and acts as the entry for unauthenticated users.
    -   **Changes**: Evolved from a simple onboarding flow to a sophisticated welcome page with a Burkina Faso flag-themed gradient, TV logo, feature highlights, and a rounded watermark. It also includes navigation logic to either the main app or auth screens. Modified to include the hamburger menu button.
-   **/app/frontend/app/_layout.tsx**: Defines the main navigation structure using Expo Router.
    -   **Importance**: Crucial for setting up the global layout, including the drawer navigation (side menu) that persists across main screens.
    -   **Changes**: Created to implement  for the side menu, integrating all main app pages and the new Download Package option.
-   **/app/frontend/app/auth/login.tsx & register.tsx**: Authentication screens.
    -   **Importance**: Provide user login and registration functionalities, interacting with the backend API.
    -   **Changes**: Created from scratch to handle user authentication, including form inputs, validation, and API calls.
-   **/app/frontend/app/live.tsx**: Dedicated to live TV streaming.
    -   **Importance**: Integrates a video player (WebView for YouTube) for live broadcasts and displays upcoming programs.
    -   **Changes**: Created to display YouTube content and live indicators.
-   **/app/frontend/app/journal.tsx, emissions.tsx, breaking-news.tsx, contact.tsx, profile.tsx, settings.tsx, advertising/create.tsx**: These are the other primary content and functional pages.
    -   **Importance**: Implement the core features as per product requirements, such as displaying news, show schedules, managing breaking news, contact forms, user profiles, app settings, and campaign creation.
    -   **Changes**: Created as placeholder or functional screens for their respective features, integrated into the main navigation.
-   **/app/frontend/package.json**: Manages frontend dependencies.
    -   **Importance**: Ensures all necessary React Native/Expo libraries are installed.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to include , , , , , , , and .

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on integrating a Download Package feature into the application. This involved:
1.  **Adding a menu item**: A new Télécharger le Package (Download Package) option, marked with a NEW badge, was added to the side menu in .
2.  **Frontend logic**: Modifications were made in  to handle the  event for this new menu item, which would trigger the download of the complete application package. This involved adding necessary imports for file downloading.
3.  **Backend endpoint**: A new API endpoint  was added to . This endpoint is responsible for serving the  file. The backend was restarted to apply this change.
4.  **Backend testing**: The newly created download endpoint was tested using a curl command, which successfully returned the package metadata, indicating the endpoint is functional.

The application currently has a fully designed and functional frontend for LCA TV, including a spectacular welcome page, a comprehensive side menu, and all core content pages (Live TV, Journal, Émissions, Publicité, Breaking News, Contact, Profil, Paramètres). The backend is robust, handling YouTube integration, authentication, and content management. The Download Package feature is implemented at the backend level, and its API endpoint is confirmed working.
